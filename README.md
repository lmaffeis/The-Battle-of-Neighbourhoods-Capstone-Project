# The Battle of Neighbourhoods Capstone Project
My Capstone Project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, in which I analysed the Neighbourhoods of Toronto applying a K-means Clustering.
You can find a PDF report and a presentation in which I exaplain the purpose of the Study, describe the Data, the Methodology and report the results as well the conclusions.
Feel free to check and comment my Python Code!
